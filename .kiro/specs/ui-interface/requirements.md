# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The SFC Wizard Agent currently operates as a command-line tool without a graphical user interface. This feature aims to add a web-based UI interface to the SFC Wizard Agent to improve usability and accessibility for users who prefer graphical interfaces over command-line interactions. The UI will provide a more intuitive way to interact with the agent's capabilities while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want a web-based UI for the SFC Wizard Agent so that I can interact with it without using the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts the SFC Wizard Agent THEN the system SHALL automatically launch a web server to serve the UI.
2. WHEN the web server is running THEN the system SHALL display the URL where the UI can be accessed.
3. WHEN the user accesses the URL THEN the system SHALL present a web interface for interacting with the SFC Wizard Agent.
4. WHEN the web interface is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and instructions for using the agent.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want to have a chat interface in the UI so that I can communicate with the agent in a conversational manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the UI THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with a message input area and a conversation history area.
2. WHEN the user enters a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL send the message to the SFC Wizard Agent for processing.
3. WHEN the agent responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the conversation history area.
4. WHEN the conversation history grows beyond the visible area THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling capabilities.
5. WHEN the agent is processing a request THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator to show that processing is in progress.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want to view and interact with SFC configurations in the UI so that I can more easily create and modify them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent generates or displays an SFC configuration THEN the system SHALL render it in a formatted, syntax-highlighted JSON viewer.
2. WHEN a configuration is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to download, copy, or edit the configuration.
3. WHEN the user edits a configuration THEN the system SHALL provide a JSON editor with validation capabilities.
4. WHEN validation errors are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight the errors and provide guidance on how to fix them.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want to see visualizations of SFC data in the UI so that I can better understand the data flow and structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent generates visualizations THEN the system SHALL render them directly in the UI.
2. WHEN visualizations are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to download or copy them.
3. WHEN the agent analyzes SFC modules THEN the system SHALL display the results in an interactive, visual format.
4. WHEN data is being processed or visualized THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want the UI to be responsive and work on different devices so that I can use it from my desktop, laptop, or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is accessed from different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt its layout appropriately.
2. WHEN the UI is accessed from a mobile device THEN the system SHALL provide a mobile-friendly experience.
3. WHEN the UI is used on a slow network connection THEN the system SHALL optimize data transfer to maintain responsiveness.
4. WHEN the UI is loaded THEN the system SHALL use modern web standards for compatibility across browsers.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an SFC developer, I want the UI to integrate with the existing SFC Wizard Agent functionality without modifying the core agent code so that all existing capabilities are preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing agent functionality.
2. WHEN the agent is updated THEN the system SHALL ensure the UI remains compatible.
3. WHEN the UI interacts with the agent THEN the system SHALL use well-defined interfaces that don't require modifying existing agent code.
4. WHEN the agent produces output THEN the system SHALL properly format and display it in the UI.
